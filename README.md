# Cross-selling health insurance

This project aims to predict whether a customer of a health insurance company would also like to purchase car insurance.
Thus, by analyzing its characteristics and using machine learning, I was able to predict which customers are most interested in car insurance.
This is important because if a company has to call all of its customers or select them randomly, the company will waste a lot of money ineffectively.
I classified the performance of the algorithms by analyzing their gain and sustain curves and precision@k and recall@k metrics.
For the final model I selected KNN, but as you can see in the code link below this algorithm wastes a considerable amount of energy to make predictions.
Therefore, it would be great to consider the ROI rate for maintaining this algorithm.

With this link you can see my project working based on a dashboard that predicts the propensity for a single customer and can list some customers by uploading a csv file. [here](https://cleversonoliveira.shinyapps.io/car_insurance_r/)

This project was carried out with the support of ComunidadDS.
