# Hypothesis Validation

```{r}
df_cleaned <- readRDS("df_cleaned.rds")
```

### H1) OLDER customers are more likely to be interested in car insurance âœ…

```{r}
# Boxplot
age_boxplot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=response, y=age)) + 
  stat_boxplot(geom='errorbar', width=0.6) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=response), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Age vs. Response Comparison", y = "Age", x = "Response") + 
  theme_bw()

ggsave("age_boxplot.jpg", plot = age_boxplot, width=4, height=6)

# Hystogram
age_plot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1, color="gray", fill="navy") + 
  facet_wrap(vars(response), nrow=2, scales="free_y") +
  labs(y="Number of Clients") +
  ggtitle("Age Distribution")

# To save a figure file
ggsave("age_plot.jpg", plot = age_plot, width=4, height=6)
```

```{r}
# Descriptive Statistics
df_cleaned %>% 
  select(age, response) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by=response) %>% 
  add_p()
```

#### Young people seems to be less likely interest in car insurance. The median age for interested customers is 43 years (IQR: 35, 51), while the median for non-interested customers is 34 years (IQR: 24, 49). \## explain the p-value

### H2) Women are likely more interested in car insurance ðŸŸ¥

```{r}
gender_plot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, gender) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = response)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill=gender), position = 'dodge') +
  labs(title = "Gender vs. Response", x = "Response", y = "Number of customers") +
    theme_bw()
  
ggsave("gender_plot.jpg", plot = gender_plot, width=4, height=6)
```

```{r}
df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, gender) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = response)
```

#### For customers interested in car insurance, 61% were men, and 39% were women. So this hypothesis is FALSE. Although, gender and response are statistically significant, i. e., are related.

### H3) Customers having newer cars are more likely to be interested in car insurance

```{r}
car_age_plot <- gender_plot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, vehicle_age) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = response)) +
  # bar chart for categorical label
  geom_bar(aes(fill = vehicle_age), position = 'dodge') +
labs(title = "Vehicle Age vs. Response", x = "Response", y = "Number of customers") +
    theme_bw()
car_age_plot
ggsave("car_age_plot.jpg", plot = car_age_plot, width=4, height=6)
```

```{r}
df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, vehicle_age) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by=response) %>% 
  add_p()
```

#### Customers who own a car between 1 and 2 years are more likely to be interested in the car insurance (75%). While, only 15% of the interested customers have new car.

### H4) Customer with previous car damage are more likely to accept car insurance âœ…

```{r}
car_damage_plot <- gender_plot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, vehicle_damage) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = response)) +
  # bar chart for categorical label
  geom_bar(aes(fill = vehicle_damage), position = 'dodge') +
labs(title = "Vehicle Damage vs. Response", x = "Response", y = "Number of customers") +
    theme_bw()
car_damage_plot
ggsave("car_damage_plot.jpg", plot = car_damage_plot, width=4, height=6)
```

```{r}
df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, vehicle_damage) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by=response) %>% 
  add_p()
```

#### Customers with previous car damage are more likely to be interested in car insurance, as 98% said yes.

### H5) Customers with previous car insurance are more likely to accept car insurance :

```{r}
car_insurance_plot <- gender_plot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, previously_insured) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = response)) +
  # bar chart for categorical label
  geom_bar(aes(fill = previously_insured), position = 'dodge') +
labs(title = "Previously Insured vs. Response", x = "Response", y = "Number of customers") +
    theme_bw()
car_insurance_plot
ggsave("car_insurance_plot.jpg", plot = car_insurance_plot, width=4, height=6)
```

```{r}
df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, previously_insured) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by=response) %>% 
  add_p()
```

#### Only 0.3& of customers interested in car insurance have car previously insured

### H6) Interest in car insurance is greater in customers which have higher annual health insurance ðŸŸ¥

```{r}
# Boxplot
expenses_boxplot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=response, y=health_annual_paid)) + 
  stat_boxplot(geom='errorbar', width=0.6) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=response), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Health Annual Paind vs. Response Comparison", y = "Annual Payment", x = "Response") + 
  theme_bw()
expenses_boxplot
ggsave("expenses_boxplot.jpg", plot = expenses_boxplot, width=4, height=6)

# Hystogram
expenses_plot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=health_annual_paid)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=10000, color="gray", fill="navy") + 
  facet_wrap(vars(response), nrow=2, scales="free_y") +
  labs(y="Number of Clients") +
  ggtitle("Expenses Distribution")
expenses_plot
# To save a figure file
ggsave("expenses_plot.jpg", plot = expenses_plot, width=4, height=6)
```

```{r}
df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, health_annual_paid) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by=response) %>% 
  add_p()
```

Although the health annual paid showed to be significant, we consider this hyphotesis false and will further investigate the outliers, in he next cycle for example.

### H7) Customers who has health insurance for LONGER are more likely to be interested in car insurance ðŸŸ¥

```{r}
# for numerical label
# Boxplot
days_boxplot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=response, y=days_associated)) + 
  stat_boxplot(geom='errorbar', width=0.6) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=response), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Days Associated vs. Response Comparison", y = "Annual Payment", x = "Response") + 
  theme_bw()
days_boxplot
ggsave("days_boxplot.jpg", plot = days_boxplot, width=4, height=6)

# Hystogram
days_plot <- df_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=days_associated)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=30, color="gray", fill="navy") + 
  facet_wrap(vars(response), nrow=2, scales="free_y") +
  labs(y="Number of Clients") +
  ggtitle("Expenses Distribution")
days_plot
# To save a figure file
ggsave("days_plot.jpg", plot = days_plot, width=4, height=6)
```

```{r}
df_cleaned %>% 
  select(response, days_associated) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by=response) %>% 
  add_p()
```

#### This Hypothesis is false, basically the interested customers and non-interested customers have the same amount of days associated. Yes(median:154 days, IQR: 82, 226); No (154 days, IQR: 82, 227).

### Hypothesis Conclusion

```{r}
